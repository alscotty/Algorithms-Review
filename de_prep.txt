üõç Example 5: External ‚Äì Amazon ‚ÄúBuy Again‚Äù Recommendations
1. Product Feature Discussion
Amazon promotes items users frequently reorder (like dog food, detergent, etc.). Encourages convenience + retention.
Places to reorder?

Logging/Schema/data modelling
purchase happens! Need to capture more info on products

Sales - store transactions - fct
ds
item_name
price
deliveryDate
vendorId
userId - user is the buyer
category
tags str[]
subCategory
itemId

users - fct
userId
.. other user metadata

user_purchase_history - dim
userId
purchaseHistory [{
    itemId: 
    countPurchases,
    datesOfPurchases
},{...}]

SQL

with sales_scrape as (
    select 
    userId,
    ARRAY_AGG(itemIds) as itemId,
    array_agg(category) as categories
    from sales
    where ds = <DATEID>
    group by userId
)
select 
userId,
purchaseHistory (merging logic add counts of new items, etc.)
from user_purchase_history uph
left join sales_scrape ss using(userId) 
where uph.ds = <DATEID -1>

python

def increment_purchase_history()
